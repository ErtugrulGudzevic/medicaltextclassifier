This project involves the development of a machine learning model using various techniques. It is designed for classifying medical texts. The fundamental steps undertaken in the project are as follows:

Data Loading and Analysis:

Relevant text data has been loaded and labeled from the "train.dat" file. Graphs and statistical information have been provided for data analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Text data has been cleaned, converted to lowercase, and stemmed when necessary.

Text Vectorization:

Text data has been represented using different vectorization methods such as Bag-of-Words (BOW), TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.

Modeling and Performance Evaluation:

Models have been trained using different classifiers (Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier - SVC). The performance of the models has been evaluated, and their successes have been compared and reported.

*** The "train.dat" file must be present in the main directory of the project.

Technologies and Libraries Used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Gensim, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, nltk
